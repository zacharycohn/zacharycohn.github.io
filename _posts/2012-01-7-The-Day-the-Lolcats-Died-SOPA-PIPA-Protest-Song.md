I'll have a full write up of this whole thing later, but a brief writeup of the last week:

*   Last Tuesday I got involved in the [fight against SOPA/PIPA](www.seattleagainstsopa.com) andÂ started [Seattle Against SOPA](www.SeattleAgainstSOPA.com)

*   Last Thursday night I had a line to a song pop into my head. "The day the lolcats died."
*   On Saturday, we shot a video.
*   On Tuesday, we launched the video: 
*   As of Friday (72 hours after launch), the video has gotten 705,000 views and driven over 4000 clicks to Life After SOPA.
