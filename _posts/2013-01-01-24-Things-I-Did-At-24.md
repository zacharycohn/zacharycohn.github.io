I turned 25 years old 88 minutes ago. I've been reflecting on the past year a lot the past few days, and I thought I would list 24 things that I did while I was 24. Next year, I might do a "25 things I did while I was 25" post. This might turn into a nice tradition, as well forcing me to get more and more interesting the older I get. :)

So, in no particular order, 24 Things I Did At 24:

1.  Joined [LIFFFT](http://www.LIFFFT.com "LIFFFT") as a Partner.
2.  Became “not incompetent” at one type of partner dancing (Blues dancing, specifically).
3.  Launched the [Seattle Customer Development Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Customer-Development-Meetup/ "Seattle Customer Development Meetup").
4.  Gave up the [Hacker News Seattle Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/HackerNewsSeattleMeetup/ "Hacker News Seattle Meetup") and handed it off to someone else.
5.  Did a [TEDx talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfjosZUZ9WM "Zac Cohn's TEDxSeattle talk").
