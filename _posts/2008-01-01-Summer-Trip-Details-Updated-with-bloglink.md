So it's been a little while since the last update. Whoops. I just wanted to fill everyone in a little on some more details about this summer:

I have a couple of goals for my trip.  
First, obviously I want to meet traceurs and traceuses from all over the country. I want to share training techniques and stories with people who are more, and less, experienced than I. I've trained with a lot of different people, and I think that I can share quite a bit of knowledge with the people I visit. That being said, I hope to learn just as much from all of the traceurs and traceuses that I meet on my trip.

Second, one of my larger goals. I am going to record this entire trip on video. I am going to edit it all together into a documentary, sort of a "This is how America Trains" kind of thing. I'll be taking a lot of footage, and I'll be releasing smaller "jam coverage" media peices throughout my trip through [American Parkour](http://www.americanparkour.com/), but look for a longer documentary at the end of August or beginning of September.

The current itinerary of major jams follows. Note, I may be arriving the night before, the morning of, or sometime during the day of these dates, depending on bus schedules:

*Saturday, June 7th - Philly Jam II

I hope to meet as many people along this trip as possible. I plan on putting together an email list to keep people informed of how and what I'm doing (if you want to be on it, comment on this post!), and I'll be making regular posts on American Parkour detailing more of the Parkour oriented aspects of my trip. You can find a lot of the pictures, videos, and bloggings [here](http://www.americanparkour.com/content/blogcategory/110/352/ "Zac's Summer Parkour Adventure"), or you can go to [American Parkour](http://www.americanparkour.com/ "American Parkour"), go to the top-menu item "Where's Zac" and see the listing there.

If you'd like to contact me about my trip, or you're interested in meeting me somewhere along the way, send me an email at zaccohn@gmail.com and let me know! I'm sure we can work something out.
