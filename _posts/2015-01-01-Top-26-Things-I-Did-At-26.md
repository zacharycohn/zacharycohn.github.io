On my birthday for the last two years, I've made lists of the [Top 24 Things I Did At 24](http://blog.zaccohn.com/uid/115792), and [The Top 25 Things I Did At 25](http://blog.zaccohn.com/top-25-parts-about-being-25). It's a fun yearly tradition that I'm continuing. Hopefully, for every year I grow older I'm forced to do more interesting things.

So, in no particular order:

1.  [Guerrilla Compliments v2](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharycohn/albums/72157650702441086)

Picture is of me doing a backflip in Egypt in front of the Great Pyramids. This was just before our guide bribed the guards to let us into the far one and keep everyone else out, so we could have a quiet, private experience.

Definitely a highlight of the year.
